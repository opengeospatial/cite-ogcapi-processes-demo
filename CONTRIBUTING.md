## Commit Guidelines



**Copyright headers**
   * If you are modifying an existing file that does not have a copyright header, then add a copyright header indicating the year the file was created and who owns the copyright. An example is below:

   ```
   /* (c) 2020 Open Geospatial Consortium - All rights reserved
    * This code is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 license, available at https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine/blob/master/LICENSE.txt
    *
    */
   ```

   * There is no need to update the copyright year when updating an existing file.
   * If there is no copyright header, create one.
